# HPI-Novice-2019
Harker Programming Invitational Novice Division - Problems and Solutions

My team got 1st place! I solved {F, G, J, K, L} while my teammates solved {A, B, C, D}. Solving problem L instead of problem I got us
the two points we needed for victory.

# TODO

 - E (Special cases galore)
 - H (????? How the hell do you do this problem)
 - I (String edit distance)
